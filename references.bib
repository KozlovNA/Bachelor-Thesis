    abstract = { Recently the Conjugate Gradients-Squared (CG-S) method has been proposed as an attractive variant of the Bi-Conjugate Gradients (Bi-CG) method. However, it has been observed that CG-S may lead to a rather irregular convergence behaviour, so that in some cases rounding errors can even result in severe cancellation effects in the solution. In this paper, another variant of Bi-CG is proposed which does not seem to suffer from these negative effects. Numerical experiments indicate also that the new variant, named Bi-CGSTAB, is often much more efficient than CG-S. }

abstract = {The development of the Lanczos algorithm for finding eigenvalues of large sparse symmetric matrices was followed by that of block forms of the algorithm. In this paper, similar extensions are carried out for a relative of the Lanczos method, the conjugate gradient algorithm. The resulting block algorithms are useful for simultaneously solving multiple linear systems or for solving a single linear system in which the matrix has several separated eigenvalues or is not easily accessed on a computer. We develop a block biconjugate gradient algorithm for general matrices, and develop block conjugate gradient, minimum residual, and minimum error algorithms for symmetric semidefinite matrices. Bounds on the rate of convergence of the block conjugate gradient algorithm are presented, and issues related to computational implementation are discussed. Variants of the block conjugate gradient algorithm applicable to symmetric indefinite matrices are also developed.}

    abstract = { The solution of complex symmetric indefinite systems of equations where multiple solutions are required is considered. The quasi-minimum residual (QMR) method, ideally suited for these matrices, is generalized using the block Lanczos algorithm to solve multiple solutions simultaneously. This modification alone is shown, through numerical examples involving large sparse matrices from finite element discretization of Maxwellâ€™s equations, to accelerate the convergence by a factor almost as great as the number of simultaneous solutions. A natural convergence criterion for this method is presented that is shown to be as effective as, and easier to compute than, the usual equation residual. Finally, a numerical comparison of the classical incomplete Cholesky and a variant of the ILU(T) preconditioners is given showing superior performance by the latter. }
